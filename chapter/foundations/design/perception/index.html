<p>Definition Perception: The top-down way our brains organize and interpret information and put it into context.</p>

<p>Definition Sensation: The bottom-up process by which our sense, like vision, hearing and touch, receive and relay outside stimuli.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-perception">What is Perception?</h3>

<p>Perception consists from three main processes called recognition, organizing, and interpreting. Recognition happens basically every day, we are aware of everything, such as sounds, lights, and colours. Then you are organizing everything that you perceive.  Interpretation refers to the process by which we represent and understand stimuli that affect us.</p>

<p>Recognizing + Organizing+ Interpreting = Sensory Information</p>

<h3 id="what-is-visual-perception">What is Visual Perception?</h3>

<p>Visual perception is the end of product of vision.</p>

<p>“Perception is not something that happens to us, or in us. It is something we do…
Vision is a mode of exploration of the environment drawing on implicit understanding 
of sensorimotor regularities”</p>

<p>The eye passes through the cornea, and go down to the iris. The light reflects and sort of vision is also a chemical reaction.</p>

<h2 id="spatial-audio">Spatial Audio</h2>

<p>Detecting a weak sensory signal like a random clap in daily life isn’t only about the strength of the 
stimulus. It is also about the psychological state, your alertness and expectations in the moment.</p>

<h3 id="signal-detection-theory">SIGNAL DETECTION THEORY</h3>

<p>Signal detection theory is a model for predicting how and when a person will detect weak stimuli, partly based on a context.
Our hearing is adjusted by our preferences by our personal perceptions that is valuable for us.</p>

<p>The paranoid parent’s brains are so trained on their baby, it gives their senses a sort of boosted 
ability, but only in relation to the subject of their attention.</p>

<h3 id="proprioception">PROPRIOCEPTION</h3>

<p>Proprioception is the perception of the world  with our body, so how perceive and understand things around us.  our perception embodied and active when we see, we are ready touch, and we tend to visualize our path to the object. Our body experienced all directions of  the environment, we understand the space in 3D. For example, when we see something that we need to grab, we will understand it is a shape.</p>

<h2 id="ui">UI</h2>

<p>UX (User experience) and UI (User interface) is different. <strong>UI</strong> can deal with traditional concepts like visual design elements such as colours and typography. <strong>UX</strong> is all below user interface. User experience design is a human-first way of designing products. Don Norman, a cognitive scientist and co-founder of the Nielsen Norman Group Design Consultancy, is credited with coining the term “user experience.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../../../../assets/figures/perception_ar/No.18(1)%20UI.jpg" style="align:left; width: 60%; height: 60%; border: 15px solid;

    <figcaption>Image of No.18(1)</figcaption>

<p>Today UI design is mainly focused on the 2D screens. We are living in a 2D world, everyone has a phone, and we use to all references to understand what the camera means, what is this icon.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../../../../assets/figures/perception_ar/No.18(2)%20UI.JPG" style="align:left; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 15px solid;

<p><em>However,</em> AR (Augmented Reality) points to use all the sense to move away from the screen. In the 60s, the person called Douglas Engelbart, he invented the modern mouse, but the aspect of that not invent something that will constantly use, it was about inventing augment human intelligence that could help us to experience our world in more senses. He wrote articles about augmenting human intelligence in using all senses that we use our bodies, speech to work with technology.</p>

<p>In 1968, Ivan Sutherland who is very famous founder of VR and MR, he said “if the task of the display is to serve as a looking glass into the mathematical wonderland constructed in computer memory, it should serve as many senses as possible”</p>

<h3 id="affordances">Affordances</h3>

<p>Affordances are the possible actions. Donald Norman (1988) said “possibilities for action that are readily perceivable by individuals”. He invented the storm and created the notion of affordances that means projects represent their functions at 3D world.</p>

<h4 id="ui-in-ar">UI in AR</h4>

<p>The lateral field of human view is about 140 degrees, but with the peripheral visual is 200-220 degrees compared to peripheral vision of the body. We need to follow the natural ways of perception, and don’t put objects on the back bunny.</p>

<p>Note: when you create UI, you need to know:</p>

<p>-Ergonomics
-Safety guidelines for the content</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clicker, laser pointer
-Other people and their voice commands</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Text</strong></p>

<p>— avoid large amounts of text to instruct of inform users with information within an augmented environment</p>

<p>— consider how you will draw attention to text within your environment to capture the user’s attention</p>

<p><strong>Colours</strong></p>

<p>— Shadows and lighting may change the way colour appears on objects and make things.</p>

<p>— By modifying the <strong>saturation</strong> and <strong>brightness</strong> of a single hue, you can generate <strong>multiple colours</strong>— darks, lights, backgrounds, accents, eye-catchers— but it’s not overwhelming on the eye.</p>

<p>— darker colours tend to carry more visual weight, and these kinds of elements need to be balanced out with lighter colours.</p>

<p><strong>The shade of the centre dot is the same in all the squares</strong></p>

<p>The shade of the background influences how we perceive it. All squares are uniformly shaded, but each square lighter on its left edge than on its right edge.</p>

<h3 id="storytelling">Storytelling</h3>

<p>Storytelling comes from writers, it can be histories, stories of legends.</p>

<h4 id="storyboarding">Storyboarding</h4>

<p>Storyboard is the collection of the shots of the images for movies that will be created.</p>

<p>But in 3D,  the simplest way is to go to the 3D modelling application, such as Unity, Maya, and Cinema 4D, to create a story using prefabs, the 3D models of objects, and explain what is going to happen with the launch examination, and how the user is going to interact with objects.</p>

<h3 id="map-your-story">Map your story</h3>

<p>This will be an inherently interdisciplinary endeavour, and it will need contributions from designers, data engineers and visualizers, brain scientists, 3D programmers, mechanical engineers, materials scientists, artists, storytellers, and others.</p>

<h3 id="uncanny-valley">Uncanny Valley</h3>

<p>You need to find that level of the character that will work in AR, and also try to find the balance between how real your character is going to be, and how empathic you want to person feels of that character. Don’t fall down about your character.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>AR UI is quite different from the traditional UI and requires new ways of approaching 
the challenge of informing and empowering users.</p>
