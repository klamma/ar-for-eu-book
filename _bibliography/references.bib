 abstract = {Badges have garnered great interest among scholars of digital media and learning.

In addition, widespread initiatives such as Mozilla's Open Badge Framework

expand the potential of badging into the realm of open education. In this paper,

we explicate the concept of open badges. We highlight some of the ways that

researchers have examined badges as part of educational practice and also highlight

the different definitions of open-ness that are employed in popular and scholarly

thought. By considering badges from three different perspectives (motivation,

pedagogy, and credential) and the concept of openness from three different

perspectives (production, access and appropriation) we develop a framework to

consider the tensions where these competing conceptions meet. This explication

illuminates how the ideas of open and badges intersect, and clarifies situations

where these concepts come into direct conflict or mutually enhance each other.

Our analysis pinpoints and elucidates particular areas where research is needed

to better understand the complex phenomenon of open badges, and also offers

design considerations for developers, educators, and organizations that are actively

involved in open badges.},

 abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of mass-market consumer software that takes inspiration from video games. Usually summarized as {\textquotedbl}gamification{\textquotedbl}, this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in human-computer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how {\textquotedbl}gamification{\textquotedbl} relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate {\textquotedbl}gamification{\textquotedbl} and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that {\textquotedbl}gamified{\textquotedbl} applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of {\textquotedbl}gamification{\textquotedbl} as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.},

 abstract = {Abstract: Motion capture is the process of recording real life movement of a subject as sequences of Cartesian coordinates in 3D space. Optical motion capture (OMC) uses cameras to reconstruct the body posture of the performer. One approach employs a set of multiple synchronized cameras to capture markers placed in strategic locations on the body. A motion capture system has applications in computer graphics for character animation, in virtual reality for human control-interface, and in video games for realistic simulation of human motion. In this tutorial, we discuss the theoretical and empirical aspects of an optical motion capture system. Basically, for a motion capture system implementation; the resources required consist of a number of synchronized cameras, an image acquisition system, a capturing area, and a special suit with markers. The locations of the markers on the suit are designed such that the required body parts (e.g. joints) are covered. We present our motion capture system using a framework that identifies different sub-problems to be solved in a modular way. The sub-problems involved in OMC are initialization, marker detection, spatial correspondence, temporal correspondence, and post-processing. In this tutorial, we discuss the theory involved in each sub-problem and the corresponding novel techniques used in the current implementation. The initialization includes setting up a human model and the computation of intrinsic and extrinsic camera calibration.},

 abstract = {By mixing digital data into the real world, Augmented Reality (AR) can deliver potent immersive and interactive experience to its users. In many application contexts, this requires the capability to deploy animated, high fidelity 3D character models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to efficiently transform - using 3D scanning - an actor to a photorealistic, animated character. This generated 3D assistant must be able to move to perform recorded motion capture data, and it must be able to generate dialogue with lip sync to naturally interact with the users. The approach we propose for creating these virtual AR assistants utilizes photogrammetric scanning, motion capture, and free viewpoint video for their integration in Unity. We deploy the Occipital Structure sensor to acquire static high-resolution textured surfaces, and a Vicon motion capture system to track series of movements. The proposed capturing process consists of the steps scanning, reconstruction with Wrap 3 and Maya, editing texture maps to reduce artefacts with Photoshop, and rigging with Maya and Motion Builder to render the models fit for animation and lip-sync using LipSyncPro. We test the approach in Unity by scanning two human models with 23 captured animations each. Our findings indicate that the major factors affecting the result quality are environment setup, lighting, and processing constraints.},

The fault, argues this ingenious-even liberating-book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior.

 abstract = {Mobile augmented reality (Mobile AR) is gaining increasing attention from both academia and industry. Hardware-based Mobile AR and App-based Mobile AR are the two dominant platforms for Mobile AR applications. However, hardware-based Mobile AR implementation is known to be costly and lacks flexibility, while the App-based one requires additional downloading and installation in advance and is inconvenient for cross-platform deployment. In comparison, Web-based AR (Web AR) implementation can provide a pervasive Mobile AR experience to users thanks to the many successful deployments of the Web as a lightweight and cross-platform service provisioning platform. Furthermore, the emergence of 5G mobile communication networks has the potential to enhance the communication efficiency of Mobile AR dense computing in the Web-based approach. We conjecture that Web AR will deliver an innovative technology to enrich our ways of interacting with the physical (and cyber) world around us. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art technology and existing implementations of Mobile AR, as well as enabling technologies and challenges when AR meets the Web. Furthermore, we elaborate on the different potential Web AR provisioning approaches, especially the adaptive and scalable collaborative distributed solution which adopts the osmotic computing paradigm to provide Web AR services. We conclude this paper with the discussions of open challenges and research directions under current 3G/4G networks and the future 5G networks. We hope that this paper will help researchers and developers to gain a better understanding of the state of the research and development in Web AR and at the same time stimulate more research interest and effort on delivering life-enriching Web AR experiences to the fast-growing mobile and wireless business and consumer industry of the 21st century.},

 abstract = {Continuous practices, i.e., continuous integration, delivery, and deployment, are the software development industry practices that enable organizations to frequently and reliably release new features and products. With the increasing interest in the literature on continuous practices, it is important to systematically review and synthesize the approaches, tools, challenges, and practices reported for adopting and implementing continuous practices. This paper aimed at systematically reviewing the state of the art of continuous practices to classify approaches and tools, identify challenges and practices in this regard, and identify the gaps for future research. We used the systematic literature review method for reviewing the peer-reviewed papers on continuous practices published between 2004 and June 1, 2016. We applied the thematic analysis method for analyzing the data extracted from reviewing 69 papers selected using predefined criteria. We have identified 30 approaches and associated tools, which facilitate the implementation of continuous practices in the following ways: (1) reducing build and test time in continuous integration (CI); (2) increasing visibility and awareness on build and test results in CI; (3) supporting (semi-) automated continuous testing; (4) detecting violations, flaws, and faults in CI; (5) addressing security and scalability issues in deployment pipeline; and (6) improving dependability and reliability of deployment process. We have also determined a list of critical factors, such as testing (effort and time), team awareness and transparency, good design principles, customer, highly skilled and motivated team, application domain, and appropriate infrastructure that should be carefully considered when introducing continuous practices in a given organization. The majority of the reviewed papers were validation (34.7{\%}) and evaluation (36.2{\%}) research types. This paper also reveals that continuous practices have been successfully applied to both greenfield and maintenance projects. Continuous practices have become an important area of software engineering research and practice. While the reported approaches, tools, and practices are addressing a wide range of challenges, there are several challenges and gaps, which require future research work for improving the capturing and reporting of contextual information in the studies reporting different aspects of continuous practices; gaining a deep understanding of how software-intensive systems should be (re-) architected to support continuous practices; and addressing the lack of knowledge and tools for engineering processes of designing and running secure deployment pipelines.},
