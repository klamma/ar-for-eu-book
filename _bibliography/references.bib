 abstract = {Badges have garnered great interest among scholars of digital media and learning.

In addition, widespread initiatives such as Mozilla's Open Badge Framework

expand the potential of badging into the realm of open education. In this paper,

we explicate the concept of open badges. We highlight some of the ways that

researchers have examined badges as part of educational practice and also highlight

the different definitions of open-ness that are employed in popular and scholarly

thought. By considering badges from three different perspectives (motivation,

pedagogy, and credential) and the concept of openness from three different

perspectives (production, access and appropriation) we develop a framework to

consider the tensions where these competing conceptions meet. This explication

illuminates how the ideas of open and badges intersect, and clarifies situations

where these concepts come into direct conflict or mutually enhance each other.

Our analysis pinpoints and elucidates particular areas where research is needed

to better understand the complex phenomenon of open badges, and also offers

design considerations for developers, educators, and organizations that are actively

involved in open badges.},

 abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of mass-market consumer software that takes inspiration from video games. Usually summarized as {\textquotedbl}gamification{\textquotedbl}, this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in human-computer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how {\textquotedbl}gamification{\textquotedbl} relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate {\textquotedbl}gamification{\textquotedbl} and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that {\textquotedbl}gamified{\textquotedbl} applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of {\textquotedbl}gamification{\textquotedbl} as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.},

 abstract = {Abstract: Motion capture is the process of recording real life movement of a subject as sequences of Cartesian coordinates in 3D space. Optical motion capture (OMC) uses cameras to reconstruct the body posture of the performer. One approach employs a set of multiple synchronized cameras to capture markers placed in strategic locations on the body. A motion capture system has applications in computer graphics for character animation, in virtual reality for human control-interface, and in video games for realistic simulation of human motion. In this tutorial, we discuss the theoretical and empirical aspects of an optical motion capture system. Basically, for a motion capture system implementation; the resources required consist of a number of synchronized cameras, an image acquisition system, a capturing area, and a special suit with markers. The locations of the markers on the suit are designed such that the required body parts (e.g. joints) are covered. We present our motion capture system using a framework that identifies different sub-problems to be solved in a modular way. The sub-problems involved in OMC are initialization, marker detection, spatial correspondence, temporal correspondence, and post-processing. In this tutorial, we discuss the theory involved in each sub-problem and the corresponding novel techniques used in the current implementation. The initialization includes setting up a human model and the computation of intrinsic and extrinsic camera calibration.},

@book{Ries11,
 abstract = {{\textquotedbl}Most startups are built to fail. But those failures, according to entrepreneur Eric Ries, are preventable. Startups don't fail because of bad execution, or missed deadlines, or blown budgets. They fail because they are building something nobody wants. Whether they arise from someone's garage or are created within a mature Fortune 500 organization, new ventures, by definition, are designed to create new products or services under conditions of extreme uncertainly. Their primary mission is to find out what customers ultimately will buy. One of the central premises of The Lean Startup movement is what Ries calls {\textquotedbl}validated learning{\textquotedbl} about the customer. It is a way of getting continuous feedback from customers so that the company can shift directions or alter its plans inch by inch, minute by minute. Rather than creating an elaborate business plan and a product-centric approach, Lean Startup prizes testing your vision continuously with your customers and making constant adjustments{\textquotedbl}--},
